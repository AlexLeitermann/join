            <p>Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban 
                project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what 
                Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.</p>
            <h2>What ist Join?</h2>
            <p>Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built 
                by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development 
                bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>
            <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective 
                method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize 
                efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to 
                help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual 
                interface.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational 
                exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we 
                strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot 
                guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other 
                aspects of quality regarding Join.</p>
            <h2>How to use it</h2>
            <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Exploring the Board</span><br>
                    <span>When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. 
                        This board represents your project and contains four default 
                        lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li><span>Creating Contacts</span><br>
                    <span>In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. 
                        Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill 
                        in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be 
                        assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</span>
                </li>
                <li><span>Adding Cards</span><br>
                    <span>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent 
                        individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new 
                        card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, 
                        assignees, etc.
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li><span>Moving Cards</span><br>
                    <span>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board 
                        by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li><span>Deleting Cards</span><br>
                    <span>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. 
                        Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution 
                        when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
                    </span>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates 
                from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current 
                state of your project.</p>
